# Companion MIDI Button Presser

This program provides a straightforward, easy-to-set-up way to press buttons in
[BitFocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion) by listening to MIDI note-on
messages.

This is useful to users of software such as [Proclaim](https://proclaim.logos.com/)
or [ProPresenter](https://www.renewedvision.com/propresenter) which can be configured
to send MIDI note-on messages (through Proclaim "[lighting scenes](https://support.proclaim.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/19863614049293-Lighting-Scenes-and-Outbound-MIDI)" or ProPresenter "[actions](https://support.renewedvision.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000020301-Devices-MIDI-ProPresenter-Setup)")
to control external devices through Companion.
